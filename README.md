# MLS Match Report Template

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! Here Iâ€™ll be sharing the code and files that I created for my Twitter accounts @sekbush22, @mlsstats, and @wslstatsbot. These visualizations were created thanks to several other repositories on GitHub including [a scraper by Ali Hasan Khan](https://github.com/Ali-Hasan-Khan/Scrape-Whoscored-Event-Data). Thanks also to [Ben Griffis](https://github.com/griffisben) for inspiration. Finally, massive thanks to [Andrew Rowlinson](https://github.com/andrewRowlinson) for the mplsoccer library.
